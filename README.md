# Music Releases
This project uses React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.

The project is part of Technigo bootcamp.

## The problem
The biggest challenge for us this week was to use our previous knowledge in Javascript and to incorporate that knowledge together with react.

We managed to get a strucure and do components the first day, but when we were trying to make functions in the code we found it more challenging. 
We did the red level, and that was what we aimed for.

If we had more time we would like to dig deeper into the problems we encountered.

## Known errors
There are 2 bugs on mobile view on iPhone:
- On Safari, the hover effect does not work.
- On Firefox there is a white line appearing in the right corner on hover effect on the albums.
On Android we don't get these errors.
